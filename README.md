#### Home Page

Refactor your homepage to use a RecyclerView for displaying Task data. This should have hardcoded Task data for now.
 you can tap on any one of the Tasks in the RecyclerView, and it will appropriately launch the detail page with the correct Task 
 title displayed.

#### Task Model

Create a Task class. A Task should have a title, a body, and a state. The state should be one of “new”, “assigned”, “in progress”, or “complete”
